                exceptional student from our K-HUB, was
                selected to represent her groundbreaking project
                at the prestigious nationwide conference,
                Leaders Connect, organized by Microsoft in New
                Delhi. This remarkable achievement was a
                testament to her remarkable talent and the
                transformative power of education.
                Udaya's journey began when she enrolled in a course program offered by Edunet, an esteemed
                educational platform. Fueled by her passion for innovation and guided by the invaluable knowledge
                gained through the program, she embarked on an extraordinary project that caught the attention of
                Microsoft.
                Her project stood as a testament to her ingenuity, perseverance, and dedication to making a
                meaningful impact in the world. The fact that Udaya's work was recognized at a national level spoke
                volumes about the quality and impact of her project.
                Representing our institution and her own extraordinary abilities, Udaya had the opportunity to
                showcase her project at the Leaders Connect conference. This platform provided a unique opportunity
